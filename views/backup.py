    **To restore a backup, follow these steps:**
    
    1. Contact your network administrator to perform the restore.
    2. If you have access to the MikroTik, run the following command through the terminal:
       ```
       /system backup load name=<file_backup name>
       ```
       
    ⚠️ *Important: Restoring will restore the previous configuration and may cause a restart of the router.*
